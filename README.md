State of Connecticut Cannabis Retail Sales by Week Ending prediction model 

This data set contains preliminary weekly retail sales data for cannabis and cannabis products in both the adult-use cannabis and medical marijuana markets. The data reported is compiled at specific points in time and only captures data current at the time the report is generated. The weekly data set captures retail cannabis sales from Sunday through Saturday of the week. Weeks spanning across two different months only include days within the same month. The first and last week of each month may show lower sales as they may not be made up of a full week (7 days). Data values may be updated and change over time as updates occur. Accordingly, weekly reported data may not exactly match annually reported data.
